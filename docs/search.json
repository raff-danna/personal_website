    "text": "The project supported by a Starting Grant awarded by the Italian Fund for Science (Fondo Italiano per la Scienza) of the Italian Ministery for Research.\nFIS grants promote the development of fundamental research, following the model of the European Research Council (ERC).\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest questions in early modern history is explaining how Europe developed “scientific” and “industrial” revolutions that allowed it to diverge from the rest of the world, eventually leading to the period of European global domination. While there are extensive literatures in the history of science and in economic history that seek to explain how the respective “revolutions” came about, attempts to connect economic and scientific change in this period are relatively limited. However, both historians of science and economic historians are converging in their research interests, as the two fields are increasingly stressing the important role of an emergent class of practitioners in promoting both theoretical and economic change in early modern Europe. WorKnow stems from this important convergence of economic history and the history of science, and aims to contribute to both fields.\nHistorians of science have investigated the sociological origins of the “scientific revolution” for a long time (Zilsel 1942; Rossi 1970). This stream of studies has documented the important role not of major scientists, but of humbler figures such as artisans and other practitioners, in making possible new alliances between natural philosophy, mathematisation, and experimentation. These studies have challenged the narratives of scientific discoveries focused on individual scientists, and have contributed to understanding the “scientific revolution” as a collective and socially embedded process (Shapin and Schaffer 1985; Kassell 2005; Long 2015). Practical texts provide direct evidence of how, starting from the late medieval period, new bodies of “practical knowledge” emerged from the world of artisans and practitioners, setting in motion broader changes in the social circulation of knowledge (P. H. Smith 2004; Roberts, Schaffer, and Dear 2007; Long 2011; Fox 2009; Bertucci 2017; P. H. Smith 2022).\nEconomic historians, together with exploring environmental, technological, institutional, and macroeconomic factors, have recently revisited the thesis that a key contribution to the “industrial revolution” came from the world of practitioners (Cipolla 1969; Berg 1994). This literature has stressed the essential role in this period of deep economic change of the knowledge promoted by practically minded enlightenment intellectuals and by humbler figures, such as artisans and other practitioners (Mokyr 2002; 2005; 2017; Berg 2007, 200; Kelly, Mokyr, and Ó Gráda 2014; Cinnirella, Hornung, and Koschnick 2022). Kelly and Ó Gráda (2022) have shown how practical mathematics is a particularly significant field to explore the connections between economic and scientific change in this crucial period.\nHowever, while some of these practitioners have received much scholarly attention (Kassell 2005; Biagioli 2006; Long et al. 2009; P. H. Smith 2022), their emergence as a long-run and incremental phenomenon is still understudied. Historians of science have mainly focused on individual practitioners rather than studying their emergence as a social phenomenon, and have not sought to reconstruct its quantitative features and its dynamics. At the same time, economic historians have not fully taken into account the epistemological relevance of the emergence of practical knowledge.

    "text": "How Practical Arithmetic Shaped Commerce and Mathematics in Western Europe, 1200-1600\n\n Harvard University Press \n\nA fine-grained account of how Indo-Arabic numerals facilitated the spread of practical knowledge in Western Europe—reshaping both commerce and mathematics in the process.\n\nOut in April 2026 | Pre-order on HUP – Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Book\n This book marks the completion of a project that began when, as a master’s student, I was struck by the parallel emergence of a new mathematical language and new commercial practices in the late medieval Mediterranean. What started as a fascination with the link between numbers and trade has kept me busy for the better part of a decade, leading me to reconstruct a story that weaves together the evolution of mathematics and the economic history of Western Europe.\nIn the thirteenth-century Mediterranean, commerce transformed as merchants shifted from Roman to Indo-Arabic numerals—an alternative that better facilitated complex calculations. It has long been known that this transition stemmed from Europe’s increasing exchanges with India, Persia, and the Arabic world. Yet much remains to be understood about how Indo-Arabic numerals—and the practical arithmetic they enabled—actually spread across Europe. As the book shows, it was hundreds of ordinary merchants, schoolmasters, and artisans who nurtured these changes, thereby driving key advances in both commerce and mathematics.\nDrawing on an original catalog of more than 1,200 practical arithmetic manuals, the book charts the incremental spread of the new figures with unprecedented precision. While Italian merchants were the early adopters, it took nearly three centuries for Indo-Arabic numerals to become established in northern Europe. These manuals reveal that adoption did not follow the routes of maritime trade. Rather, Indo-Arabic numerals moved gradually across the continent through inland networks of practitioners. Everywhere they went, the ten figures enhanced commercial practices and facilitated the emergence of a coherent language of mathematical craft. The growing social circulation of this knowledge, in turn, had a lasting impact on the economic trajectory of Western Europe. By the late sixteenth century, even academics were absorbing lessons from the vernacular tradition—a development that led to the first major breakthroughs in European mathematical theory since antiquity.\nCombining economic history with the social history of mathematics, The Craft of Indo-Arabic Numerals illuminates the integral role of practical arithmetic in both intellectual and commercial transformations across Western Europe.\n\n\n\n\nPraise\n\nIn this landmark study, Danna demonstrates the profound implications of the adoption and diffusion of Indo-Arabic numerals across Europe. Tracing how the ten figures impacted the evolution of practical mathematics, he illuminates the far-reaching consequences for the growth of commerce and manufacturing. Meticulously researched and documented, this book will change the way we think about the history of the growth of useful knowledge. A must-read for any scholar interested in the origins of the European Miracle.\n— Joel Mokyr, Nobel Prize–winning author of A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy\n\n\nA profoundly intelligent book. Danna is not content simply to describe the shift from Roman to Indo-Arabic numerals; he delves deeply into the cognitive and symbolic revolution it represented. This is a rare work that takes the intellectual substance of a practical craft seriously, revealing how a new way of calculating became a new way of thinking.\n— Sheilagh Ogilvie, author of The European Guilds: An Economic Analysis\n\n\nThis important work exemplifies the history of knowledge at its finest, combining the social history of mathematics with broader themes in economic and technological history. Using quantitative analysis alongside detailed case studies, Raffaele Danna illuminates the multifaceted influence of mathematical practitioners in early modern societies.\n— Thomas Morel, author of Underground Mathematics: Craft Culture and Knowledge Production in Early Modern Europe\n\n\nA powerful account of how practical mathematics became intertwined with the growth of ​late medieval and early modern capitalism in Europe. Marshaling a vast array of evidence, Raffaele Danna shows how Indo-Arabic numerals gradually spread across the continent and became far more than mere tools for calculation. The result is an extraordinary history of how Europeans first came to use the numbers and mathematics that we rely on today.\n— Patrick Wallis, author of The Market for Skill: Apprenticeship and Economic Growth in Early Modern England\n\n\nAn important and original contribution. Drawing on more than 1,200 arithmetic manuals written for ordinary users, Raffaele Danna shows how Indo-Arabic numerals spread across Europe through networks of practitioners, revolutionizing first commerce and then elite mathematics.\n— Morgan Kelly, Professor of Economics at University College Dublin"
