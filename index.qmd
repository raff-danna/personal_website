I am an historian working on economic history and the history of science. I believe that exploring the interconnections of technical, scientific, and economic processes is essential to understand the complexity of historical change.

After a PhD in History at the University of Cambridge and a Max Weber Fellowship at the European University Institute, I am a researcher at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa.
