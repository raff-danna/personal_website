I am an historian working on economic history and the history of science. My research focuses on how technical, scientific, and economic processes interact to produce historical change.
<br><br>

I am an Assistant Professor (tenure track) at the Institute of Economics of the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies (Pisa).
<br>

I completed my PhD in History at the University of Cambridge and was previously a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute. <br><br><br>
