I am an historian working on economic history and the history of science. I believe that exploring the interconnections of technical, scientific, and economic processes is essential to understand the complexity of historical change.

I am a researcher at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa. I hold a PhD in History from the University of Cambridge and I have been a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute. <br><br><br>
