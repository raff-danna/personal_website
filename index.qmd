<br>
I am an historian working on economic history and the history of science. I am interested in how technical, scientific, and economic processes interact to produce historical change. 
<br>

My first book explores how Indo-Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3…) spread across Europe, reconstructing both a social history of practical mathematics and an economic history of late medieval and early modern Europe. 
<br><br>

I am Assistant Professor (tenure track) at the Institute of Economics of the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies (Pisa).
<br>

I completed my PhD in History at the University of Cambridge and was previously a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute. <br><br>
