While there are extensive literatures in the history of science and in economic history that seek to explain how the respective “revolutions” came about, attempts to connect economic and scientific change in this period are relatively limited. However, both historians of science and economic historians are converging in their research interests, as the two fields are increasingly stressing the important role of an emergent class of practitioners in promoting both theoretical and economic change in early modern Europe. WorKnow stems from this important convergence of economic history and the history of science, and aims to contribute to both fields.\n\n**Historians of science** have investigated the sociological origins of the “scientific revolution” for a long time (Zilsel 1942; Rossi 1970). This stream of studies has documented the important role not of major scientists, but of humbler figures such as artisans and other practitioners, in making possible new alliances between natural philosophy, mathematisation, and experimentation. These studies have challenged the narratives of scientific discoveries focused on individual scientists, and have contributed to understanding the “scientific revolution” as a collective and socially embedded process (Shapin and Schaffer 1985; Kassell 2005; Long 2015). Practical texts provide direct evidence of how, starting from the late medieval period, new bodies of “practical knowledge” emerged from the world of artisans and practitioners, setting in motion broader changes in the social circulation of knowledge (P. H. Smith 2004; Roberts, Schaffer, and Dear 2007; Long 2011; Fox 2009; Bertucci 2017; P. H. Smith 2022).\n\n**Economic historians**, together with exploring environmental, technological, institutional, and macroeconomic factors, have recently revisited the thesis that a key contribution to the “industrial revolution” came from the world of practitioners (Cipolla 1969; Berg 1994). This literature has stressed the essential role in this period of deep economic change of the knowledge promoted by practically minded enlightenment intellectuals and by humbler figures, such as artisans and other practitioners (Mokyr 2002; 2005; 2017; Berg 2007, 200; Kelly, Mokyr, and Ó Gráda 2014; Cinnirella, Hornung, and Koschnick 2022). Kelly and Ó Gráda (2022) have shown how practical mathematics is a particularly significant field to explore the connections between economic and scientific change in this crucial period.\n\n**However**, while some of these practitioners have received much scholarly attention (Kassell 2005; Biagioli 2006; Long et al. 2009; P. H. Smith 2022), their emergence as a long-run and incremental phenomenon is still understudied. Historians of science have mainly focused on individual practitioners rather than studying their emergence as a social phenomenon, and have not sought to reconstruct its quantitative features and its dynamics. At the same time, economic historians have not fully taken into account the epistemological relevance of the emergence of practical knowledge. **WorKnow seeks to bridge this gap** by creating a dialogue between these streams of literature and by reconstructing in unprecedented detail the emergence of practitioners and of practical knowledge in early modern Europe.\n\n#### **Within this project**\n\n[Special Issue](https://www.museogalileo.it/it/attivita/news/call-for-abstracts-galilaeana-knowledge-in-use.html) of *Galilaeana – Studies in Renaissance and Early Modern Science*.
